# priority-queue-binary-heap
C++ program that supports three methods/conditions, implementing a priority queue with a binary heap. The main program displays three options to the user- inserting an item into the heap, deleting the minimum value, and printing the array. The project has no other contributors, and does not have current maintaining of the program. The header file is attached. Instructions are below: 

```
bool isEmpty(): it will return true if the heap is empty, false otherwise.
void insert(int value): inserts a value into the queue.
Hints: Insertion should keep, as far as possible, maintaining the binary tree as a complete binary tree. The insertion of the new value may violate the heap property.
int deleteMin(): returns the minimum in the queue and deletes it from the Queue. 
```
